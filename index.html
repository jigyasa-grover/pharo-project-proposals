<body><h1>Pharo GSOC 2019: Ideas List</h1>
    <a href="http://www.pharo.org"><img src="http://www.pharo.org/files/pharo.png"/></a>
    <p>Welcome to the one-stop-shop for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code 2019</a> with Pharo Consortium aspiring to provide the ultimate immersive programming experience..
        <a href="http://www.pharo.org">Pharo</a> is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).
    </p>
    <h3>A glimpse of Pharo</h3>
    <pre>$ wget -O- https://get.pharo.org/64 | bash 
        $ ./pharo Pharo.image eval &quot;42 factorial&quot;</pre>
    <h3>Teaser</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple &amp; powerful language:</strong> No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages <em>all the way down</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Live, immersive environment:</strong> Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazing debugging experience:</strong> The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pharo is yours:</strong> Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing constantly with frameworks and libraries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="for-students">General Information for Students</h3>
    <p> Hello Pharo enthusiasts ! Thank you for your interest in Pharo Consortium. The pre-requisites for applying include knowledge about object oriented programming, basic idea about Pharo/Smalltalk syntax. 
      The idea list for the possible projects is a result of contributions from developers and users which might not be complete on their own. As a prospective student, you should contact the developer and/or the project maintainer, for further clarifications, discussions and the interest in the project during the application period should be made pretty evident via your Github contributions and interactions with the mentors (EMails, mailing lists, chat channels, etc.). If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on the general Pharo development list <a href="mailto:pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org">pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org</a>. See the <a href="http://pharo.org/community">Pharo community page</a> for information on available mailing lists and how to subscribe. Being accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive. Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential mentors. Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work. On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors is unlikely to work out as well.</p>
    <h3 id="adding-a-proposal">Adding a proposal as a mentor</h3>
    <p>In case you are a Pharo developer and have a compelling idea for this year's Google Summer of Code, we shall be happy to include your proposal to the list. Kindly add your project idea to the list of topics in the following template on github (here at <a href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/Topics.st">github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/master/Topics.st</a>) and send a pull request.</p>

Data is central in all those fields. Visualizing data in charts is very important for understanding it and presenting the results. Even though Roassal can be used for plotting data, it has a very generic API and makes even the most simple charts very complicated. Other tools like MatplotLibBridge or ChartJS are just connectors to external libraries which create static images and do not allow us to use some of the most valuable features of Pharo environment, such as live inspection and debugging.</td>

                <td> IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices
                    with the same system of files.
                    In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm,
                    exchanging objects within one Git repository.
                    In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks.
                    This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains,
                    and even a Permanent Web.
                    IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace.
                    IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.
                    IPFS right now is implemented as a server process in Go and allows the global file system to be mounted as a user
                    space filesystem. In addition, the server provides an API.
                    A real integration of IPFS with Pharo would require a complete implementation of IPFS in Pharo
                    (projects are already in early stages to implement it in JavaScript and Python).
                    But the client API allows us already now to do experiments and assess the usefulness of IPFS in the context of Pharo.

Lastly, the third goal is to improve packaging & deployment of such native applications in Pharo, as well as evaluating the integration with other frameworks (Bloc to display GUI for example). The third goal has to be clearly detailled in the student proposal - we will not accept topics not improving the Core Pharo system. In addition, the demo game created should be submitted to this year LPC event (competition from June 1st to July 31st) to show Pharo to other communities.</td>

                    with around 100 classes. But new collections exist such as BTree, QuadTree, SkipList, Trie, …
                    Containers is an existing effort to gather many of the existing collection developed individually and externally to Pharo into a single umbrella. The idea is to create a modular collection library for Pharo users. Containers’s goals is to develop new efficient, well-tested, well documented collections.
                    Containers contains already Tree, Grid, SkipList, LinkedList, OrderedDictionary but there is a need to revisit them.
                    Finally Pharo 6.0 comes with two powerful primitives: new object immutability primitives as well as ephemerons [Hayes97].
                    With such important primitives two tasks can be performed:
                    - design new weak collections taking advantage of ephemerons.
                    - revisit and design new concurrent collections taking advantage of immutability.

However this execution should not expose the file system and machine resources. The idea of this problem is to run Pharo in a container and expose it in a web application. Such an isolated infrastructure could be useful for experimenting with Pharo trhough a Web page.</td>
